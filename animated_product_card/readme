This is a animated product card made purely from HTML and CSS no javascript, it demonstrates an interactive animation which starts as a simple logo and, on hover, transforms into a detailed product-reveal card with several sequential animations.

What happens:

- Start as a simple Coca-Cola logo.
- On hover the logo transforms into a rectangle and reveals the product.

Features:

Pure CSS: Animations handled by CSS transitions and keyframes.

Shape Morphing: The main container transitions it's border-radius, width and background-color.

Sequenced-animations: Animations are sequenced by transitions-delay to ensure animations do not overlap.

Compound Transforms: The content animates using a combination of opacity, scale and translateX.

Parent Hover Selector: All animations are triggered by a single :hover on the main container.

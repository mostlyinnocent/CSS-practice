Making a 3d card that tilts on mouse positioning.

This card displays contains the following:
Nike logo
Price tag
product image
product info (name and description)
Add to cart and Buy now buttons

How I achieved the result:

Making the main Container:
-> Create a div which will be our card, set the display to flex and flex direction to column that way the elements in the card will be displayed one after the other.

Setting up price tag and logo.
-> Because i wanted the logo and price tag to be shown in a row I used flex box display again and set the justify content to space around.

-> The container which contains the logo, has a fixed size. On the image tag I used the contain method so that the logo can be displayed in a small space. If I had used cover instead of contain method the logo would have been cropped and not displayed fully.

-> Then added margin accordingly so that the elements have some space from the edges of the card.

Setting up the product Image:
-> Created a container div for the image, setting flex= 2, so that it takes up unused space by other elements. This way no unnecessary gap is needed and the item is resized accordingly to other elements that are added below it.

-> The img tag had the cover method to show the product image in it's full aspect ratio, since it had not fixed height or width and I wanted the product image to be displayed completely.

Setting up the product name and description:
-> created a h3 and p tag and typed in the corresponding text, formatted them to fit into the card container nicely.

Setting up the cart and buying options:
-> created a container func-buttons
-> btn-1 and btn-2 are the corresponding buttons.

Creating the 3D lift on hover effect:
-> To create the 3D effect i had to remove the overlay: hidden clips everything that extends beyond the element's boundaries. When using translateZ() pushes the items forward, outside the card's original boundary. Without overlay: hidden elements are free to extend beyond the original boundaries hence creating the 3d-effect.

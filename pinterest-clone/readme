My Pinterest-Style Layout:

Hey there! This is a simple project I put together to create a responsive webpage layout that looks and feels a lot like Pinterest. It's built with just plain HTML and CSS.

What's Inside?

index.html: This is the main page. It has all the structure, like the top search bar, the sidebar for navigation, and, of course, the container for all the image "pins."

style.css: This is where all the magic happens! It styles everything, from the colors and fonts to the really cool layouts.

Cool Features

I'm pretty happy with how a few key things turned out:

CSS Grid Layout: The main page structure (the sidebar on the left and the top bar/content on the right) is all handled by CSS Grid. It's super clean and keeps things organized.

Masonry Pin Grid: The best part! The images in the main content area are in a "masonry" grid, just like on Pinterest. This means the columns are all the same width, but the images stack neatly on top of each other, even though they all have different heights. I achieved this using the columns property in CSS, which is a really simple way to get this effect.

It's Responsive!: The layout totally changes for smaller screens.

On Desktop: You get the classic layout with the sidebar on the left.

On Mobile (768px wide or less): The layout switches! The sidebar on the left disappears and is replaced by a navigation bar that sticks to the bottom of the screen, just like the Pinterest mobile app. The pin grid also slims down to just two columns so it's easy to browse.

How to Check It Out

Super easy:

Make sure both index.html and style.css are in the same folder.

Just double-click and open the index.html file in any web browser.

Try resizing your browser window to see the responsive layout in action!
